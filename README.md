# DAND-Project2
Project 2 for Term 1 Data Analyst Nanodegree with Udacity

Exploring US Bikeshare Data:
This project was completed as part of the course requirements of Udacity's Data Analyst Nanodegree certification.

Bike sharing data from three large cities (Chicago, New York City, and Washington, DC) was provided.
The task was to write a python script which allowed the user to get the following statistics:

  #1 Popular times of travel (i.e., occurs most often in the start time):
  
    most common month
    most common day of week
    most common hour of day
 
  #2 Popular stations and trip:
  
    most common start station
    most common end station
    most common trip from start to end (i.e., most frequent combination of start station and end station)

  #3 Trip duration:
  
    total travel time
    average travel time

  #4 User info:
  
    counts of each user type
    counts of each gender (only available for NYC and Chicago)
    earliest, most recent, most common year of birth (only available for NYC and Chicago)
